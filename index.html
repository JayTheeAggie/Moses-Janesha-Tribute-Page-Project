                "Flow Arts is a general term used to describe the intersection of a variety of movement-based disciplines including dance, juggling, fire-spinning, and object manipulation. The broad category Flow Arts includes a variety of pursuits that harmonize skill-based techniques with creative expression to achieve a state of present-moment awareness known as Flow.
            </p>

            <p>Common forms of Flow Arts include Poi & Staff spinning, hula hoop (or “hooping”), juggling, sphere manipulation (or “contact juggling”), and fan dance. New props and expressions are emerging all the time as flow artists cross pollinate with martial arts, yoga, circus, belly dance, and beyond."

                <p>The hula hoop is where my love for flow arts began!  
                While the modern hula hoop has only been around since the 1950s, 
                this simple toy has been bringing joy to flow artists around the globe for centuries.
                The ancient Greeks used their hoops made from metal, bamboo, wood, grass, and sometimes even vines to keep those abdominal muscles tight. It <em>is</em> great core exercise!
                In the 1300s, the British sailors traveling abroad likened the movements of hula hooping to those of Hawaiian hula dancing.
                Thus, the name "hula hoop" was born!  After a ban on the toy in 1965, the hula hoop came back with a new and improved sound effect and stuck around for good.</p>

        <h2>Contact Staff</h2>

                <p>The staff, sometimes known as the stave, has multiple different is a multi-faceted flow prop, much like the hula hoop.
                The types of staffs range from the orignial contact staff to dragon staffs, fire staffs, and even S-staffs, which are named for their curvy "S" shape.
                Many of the modern contact staff techniques come from the baton twirling community and the Chinese art and weapon known as Fei-Cha. </p>

        <h2>Poi Balls</h2>

            <p>The Maori translation of Poi is, believe it or not, simply "ball on a string"! 
                Originally, Maori warriors in New Zealand used poi balls as a way to train for hunting and battle. 
                They swung the heavy balls to develop wrist strength and flexibility to handle various tools and weapons. 
                Eventually poi became used as a form of storytelling and dance, and now it is a favorite weapon in the arsenal of many flow artists all over the world!

        <h2>Dance Pole</h2>

            <p>One of my personal favorite flow props is actually this taboo classic!
            According to <a href="https://www.polefitnessstudio.com/">PoleFitnessStudio.com</a>, pole dancing originated as a form of circus entertainment during the Great Depression.
            However, the history of <em>mallakhamb</em>, an Indian sport which uses principles of endurance and strength using a wooden pole, goes back 800 years.
            The travelling side shows in the early American history of pole dancing also featured acts like belly dancing, which is evident in today's pole dance styles!
            Finally, pole dancing was made more mainstream in America when it was featured in 1950 in Elvis' Jailhouse Rock music video. Today, pole dance lives on through gymnasts, club dancers, entertainers, etc.

        <h2>Aerial Lyra</h2>

        <img src="./Resources/Photos/lyra.jpeg" alt="Woman Lying on Aerial Lyra Outline with Purple Flowers in a Forest, Touching Her Reflection in a Pond" class="lyra">
        <figcaption>
            <p>The aerial lyra, or aerial hoop, is close cousins with the hula hoop.  
                The only difference is insead of being a loose object for manipulation, the lyra is an aerial prop that suspends the user in air via the hoop.
                The first recorded aerial hoop performance was in New York in 1893.  Believe it or not, it was just marketing for the <em>New York Clipper</em>.
                Now you'll find aerial hoop performances all over the web, as entertainment while gambling in casinos, and sweeping the stages of dance acts across the world.
